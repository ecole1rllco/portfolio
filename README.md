# 🌸 Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio, where I showcase the projects I’ve built, the skills I’m passionate about, and how to get in touch. It’s a fully responsive web app built with React, Node.js, and AWS, featuring a playful, interactive front end and a dependable backend that effortlessly handles messages and other server-side tasks.

## 🌱 The Features

* **Interactive Landing Page:** A friendly typing animation welcomes every visitor.  
* **Skills Carousel:** Browse my technical skills with a smooth, animated carousel.  
* **Project Showcase:** Check out some of my favorite projects with descriptions and links.  
* **Functional Contact Form:** Send me a message directly through a ready-to-use contact form.  
* **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on phones, tablets, and desktops. 

## 🛠️ The Tools I Used

### Frontend

* **React:** Organizes the UI into clean, reusable components.  
* **React-Bootstrap:** Makes layouts responsive and easy to manage.  
* **React-Multi-Carousel:** Powers the smooth skills carousel. 

### Backend

* **Node.js & Express:** Handles server-side functionality, including the contact form.  
* **Nodemailer:** Sends emails reliably.  
* **Google APIs (OAuth2):** Ensures emails are sent securely through Gmail.  
* **Serverless-http:** Makes the backend serverless and easy to deploy.
